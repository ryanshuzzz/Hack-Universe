# Hack-Universe

## What is Hack Universe?

Hack Universe is a simple webapp which allows users navigate through space to explore different solar systems, and planets within these solar systems. This webapp uses random integer generation to determine the: size of the planets, size of the sun, number of planets in a solar system, speed of orbit, and orbit distance. All of this was done using the the javascript library p5.js.

## Goals of Hack Universe

The goal of this application is to hopefully show the user the vastness of space. If further implemented this could be used as a tool to teach people about solar systems, orbits of planets, and the expansion of the universe.
